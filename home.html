            <h3>I am Naiemur Rahaman Riaz. I am 17 years old. Now I read in class 11 in comilla govt. college. I am the 2nd child of our family. 
                I always go to college everyday(although not now)!!. But i always attend in online class regularly. I always like sit on the 2nd or 3rd
                bench in the class. I always finished my leason everyday. I never put off today,s leasons for tomorrow(without any serious reasons).
                I always like to proper use of time. I always respect my parents,teachers and elders. I do not always follow the rules of health.
                I always try to speak the truth(!! sometimes not only speak truth but also lie !!).My favourite hobby is triping any new place.
                And my another hobby is sleeping.I always try to get up early in the morning (without some days or without free time). I always
                try to say my prayers five times daily in time (it is not true.because sometimes/{maximum time} i don't say prayers.). I have some
                drems. I want to be an ideal citizen..EVERYBODY PRAY FOR ME.
